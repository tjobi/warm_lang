# warm_lang
The idea is to develop a compiled programming language. The compile target should be the Common Language Runtime (CLR)

## How to run

Use the following command (or your favourite IDE play button)
```console
dotnet run --project WarmLangCompiler
```

Or you can provide a target by arguement:

```console
dotnet run --project WarmLangCompiler <program>
```

You can get command line help by using the `-lh` or `--lang-help` flag(s).
